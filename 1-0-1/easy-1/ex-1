Explination
-> The 'repeat' method is set up to take in a string and an integer. To 
get the string to repeat by the size of the given integer, we need to use 
the 'times' operator and set the 'num' to it. Once that is accomplished we 
have to indicate what will be done said number times. To do this we can 
simply type 'puts str'. This will allow the product to printed when the 
information has been given.

def repeat(str, num)
  num.times do
    puts str
  end
end

repeat('hello', 3)

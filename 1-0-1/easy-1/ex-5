Explination:
-> The method creates two variables that contain pre-set strings that form 
a box once the user inputs a string. The box is also slightly adaptive, so 
that it will add space on either side of the quote. It does this by adding 
two to the actual ".size" of the input (aka message).  


def print_in_box(message)
  top_bottom = "+#{'-' * (message.size + 2)}+"
  sides = "|#{' ' * (message.size + 2)}|"
  if message.size <= 80 
    \n
  end
  puts top_bottom
  puts sides
  puts "| #{message} |"
  puts sides
  puts top_bottom
end

print_in_box('To boldly go where no one has gone before.')

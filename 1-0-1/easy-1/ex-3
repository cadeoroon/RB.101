Explination
-> This method takes the given integer and performs repeating process till 
it reaches its size. The process is equated to a variable 'number'. 
'number' sees if the integer is even or odd and prints 1 or 0 based on the 
response. The value of the 'number' if pushed to the 'numbers' array 
created earlier in the method. then at then end the array transitions 
into a single string using the .join operator. The final result is a 
string of 1's and 0's.

def stringy(num)
  number = []

  num.times do |index|
    number = index.even? ? 1 : 0
    numbers << number
  end

  numbers.join
end
